- Through which we predict the suitable location to open a restaurant in Bangalore.
- what should be the 'price for one' to open a kitchen
- Cuisine our client should sell according to famous cuisines served in Bangalore.
- Also made Machine learning models to predict price for one at a particular location and for a particular cuisine.
#### Here we take two inputs from the user which are as follows:

- Location
#### Output we get are as follows:
- Average price for one in this area
- Popular cuisine for that area
- Most popular Restaurant in this area
