## Creation of ML model 
- After scrapping the data we have created two logistic regression models 
- Through which we predict the suitable location to open a restaurant in Bangalore 
- what should be the 'price for one' to open a kitchen
- Cuisine our client should sell according to famous cuisines served in Bangalore
- Integrated the ML model with the help of Flask and Pickle
## Created the Dynamic webpage with the help of HTML CSS
